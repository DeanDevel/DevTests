# Welcome to my Developer Challenges / Tests 
This is a space on the Github Realm of things to showcase my coding challenges from various companies 
which include various programming langauges e.g "PHP, mysql, Python, C and etc" also to include if 
needed by the challenge e.g "frameworks: Laravel, Vue, Bootstrap and etc". All code will live
here in this repo and also include a README.md, images and if needed extra materials with instructions.
